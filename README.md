"Texturing & Modeling, a Procedural Approach" (2nd Edition, 1st & 3rd Editions also Available) by David S. Ebert, F. Kenton Musgrave, Darwyn Peachey, Ken Perlin, Steven Worley
- Excellent book that goes over various procedural texture algorithms in detail, recommended for those getting into procedural graphics.
